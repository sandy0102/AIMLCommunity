# AIMLCommunity Projects
# BREAST CANCER DETECTION PROJECT as a part of Data Science for Social Good initiative.

#The data being used is The Breast Cancer Dataset which is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29

# Objectives
The objective of this project is to observe the breast cancer dataset and do analysis and get an insight into the features which are helpful to predict malignant or benign cancer.  The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. Since this is a binary classification problem, I  have used machine learning classification method to fit a function that can predict the class of the diagnosis column.

# Results
Tried 3 models - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classfier and found that Random Forest Classifer gave  the best testing model accuracy of 97% compared to others.


# COVID 19 DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

In this project we will be analysing the COVID 19 dataset and gaining meaningful insights from the data.

This project focuses on Scraping and cleaning the Covid 19 dataset obtained from Worldometer website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus and visualizing it and deploying on Heroku. The tools that are being used are Python and its libraries, Frontend tools like HTML, CSS, Frontend framework flask, Git and Heroku. We will be designing a frontend and deployment will be done on Heroku.
